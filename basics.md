## What is Superdash?
Superdash is one of the variants in Variant Mode, which is unlocked by completing Chapter 8C. 
It gives Madeline’s dash some new properties with useful applications for speedrunning!

**Longer dash length**
- Allows you to input a wallbounce or hyper/super much later than normal
- The length of a dash can greatly increase if you have lots of speed, but the dash always lasts the same duration.

**Ability to curve your dash up to 90 degrees**
- Allows you to transfer your speed into any direction

**Ability to dash before the current dash ends**
- Allows you to preserve and continue to build your speed

Aside from these differences, gameplay functions the same. You are still able to hyper, wallbounce, etc., which are still central to speedrunning.

## Why speedrun Superdash?
- The movement is very high-paced, fluid, and overall really satisfying.
- We are a small but dedicated community. This also means you can climb the speedrun.com leaderboards easier. >:)
- It’s easier to get lower times in Any% due to some easy timesaves, like 4A first autoscroller room.
- It’s not hard! (see below)

## Speedrunning Superdash is probably easier than you think!

According to other runners I’ve talked to, Superdash was much easier to learn than most people think.

Superdash at a glance may seem like learning an entire new game, but learning Superdash is simply an extension of normal Celeste. The physics and core mechanics remain the same and have the same familiar feel, even with the addition of high-speed strats and curving. It is also a viable strategy to use the same vanilla strats in a Superdash run, so the barrier to entry is quite low! Superdash is by no means a big commitment, especially if you just want to pick a single level to practice and submit to speedrun.com!

Skill definitely also carries over from vanilla. Runners in the past have been able to beat their normal Any% times within a few runs. Once you get accustomed to the basic mechanics, Superdash can also be just as consistent as normal Celeste.

## Superdash can be played optimally on all control schemes!

(including keyboard, controller d-pad, and analog stick)

Contrary to widespread belief, Superdash works the same on every basic control scheme. The game only uses inputs in the 8 main directions, even on an analog stick. **The way Superdash curving works is by slowly moving you in the direction you are holding, at a rate of about 4 degrees per frame. Most curving in the speedrun can be achieved by dashing in one direction, then switching to holding a new direction.**

On the speedrun.com Superdash Any% leaderboards, 1st place uses the analog stick and 2nd place uses keyboard. Out of the 8 sub 40 minute runs, there is a 50/50 split between analog and non-analog players. 

Curving a dash may feel less intuitive on buttons or keys at first, but with practice, inputting curves becomes snappy and precise, possibly even more so than on analog.

<summary>Sidenote: An overly technical look at Superdash + Analog:</summary>
  
The only use of analog movement (besides feathers of course) in Superdash TASes is to do a reverse ultrahop 1 frame faster than normal. This is done by curving a left dash downward with a down input that is angled slightly right of directly downwards. This allows you to then curve right (because it is now within ~90 degrees of difference) while reversing the hyper, maintaining the ultrahop boost. By the way, reverse ultrahops are not even humanly viable. Analog is clearly broken for Superdash guys!!!

Here is the original explanation of how analog is used in TASing.

Basically, although the game converts analog directions to digital ones for movement, it checks for some properties of the dash separately in their original analog form. This is also the reason why the analog stick was capable of easy upwards demodashes before Update 1.4.0.0 introduced an in-game demo button, which now allows all control schemes to input easy upwards demodashes.

## How do speed chains work?
Hypering and then quickly dashing and curving into the direction you want to go is a simple yet effective way to make use of Superdash speed. You can even use this to travel upwards faster.  For building and keeping speed for longer periods of time, there are a few things you should know.

Speed chains mostly consist of a mix of **downright dashes** and **arcing**, two techniques that are **fundamental to superdash** and have their own unique uses.

**Downright dashes** give a 1.2x speed multiplier and an additional 1.2x multiplier if initiated on the ground, for a total of about **1.44x speed.** This makes it the best way to build speed, but it is only possible on flat ground. As you gain more speed, your dash gets longer, making it difficult to find enough ground to downright dash without hitting a wall or failing to refresh your dash.

**Arcing** refers to a very commonly used tech where you **dash diagonally up, then curve diagonally down.** Curving diagonally down during a dash allows you to maintain speed even after the dash ends. If your dash ends in the air, you get a **1.2x speed multiplier** upon landing. You can then use this speed by jumping (and maybe arcing again) or dashing downright. 

Arcing is the Superdash application of **ultradashing,** which also means buffering a jump after an arc may not give you the 1.2x speed. The motion of an arc transfers more speed forwards, and it gives you the freedom to maneuver around bumpy terrain while keeping speed. 

[Here is a video breaking down what goes on in a typical speed chain.]()

In summary, you usually want to start with a **source of speed** like a hyper, **downright dash** when possible, and **arc** to maintain speed across bumpier terrain. Be sure to avoid hitting walls or ceilings, because this breaks the speed chain. Learning speed chains is more about practicing the chain rather than improvising, but it is still good to know how and why they work.

## Tips for Inputting Arcs
The simplest way to think of inputting an arc is first dashing while holding upright, then switching to holding downright in the middle of the dash. The moment you begin to hold downright, the dash will slowly curve/adjust in that direction at a speed of 4 degrees/frame. Although it may seem counterintuitive to curving, there is no need to gradually change directions; the game does this for you. 

If you are trying to arc and aim for a small platform, hold downright when you are at about the midpoint between where you dashed and the platform. Because superdashes curve at a consistent rate and have a set duration, directing your arcs like this proves very consistent, even with varying speeds.

Hold upright, let go of up while continuing to hold right, then roll the thumb downward to hit down as well
</details>

<details>
<summary>Input for Keyboard</summary>
  
Hold upright, continue to hold right, and move the middle finger from up to down.

Perform a quick quarter-circle motion from upright to downright. Superdashes do not use analog angles, so there is no need to move the stick gradually.
