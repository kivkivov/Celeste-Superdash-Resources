# Superdash Tech

Most, if not all tech in vanilla Celeste is possible with Superdash. In addition, Superdash offers a variety of new techniques.

## How to optimize speed chains
While this isn't a tech, it's helpful to know how to get more speed while doing the same set of movements.

Tip 1: It is better to be in a dash than not, since you do not lose speed while in a dash. If you want to hyper into an upright dash, you will go much faster if you input the upright dash as soon as possible. Waiting to input the dash can cause you to lose a surprising amount of speed.

Tip 2: When dashing and curving, speed is transferred in the direction of the dash. If you dash upright and curve up, most of your speed will be transferred upwards. If you dash downright and curve right, most of your speed will be transferred right. This concept is important because if you want to optimize for horizontal speed, you want the angle of your dash to stay as horizontal as possible. **Fast arcing**, which is when you dash up+forward, curve down+forward, then curve forward, is an application of this.

## Techniques

### Dash Chaining
In vanilla Celeste, you must wait until a dash ends before dashing again. In Superdash, this dash timer is the same length, even though the dash now continues for longer. This allows you to cancel your dash into another dash, which can be used to preserve or build speed.

### Ultra Dash
In vanilla Celeste, ultras are performed by dashing diagonal down in midair, landing, then jumping to get a 1.2x speed boost. Ultras are also possible in Superdash, with diagonal down curves being most frequently used to perform them. **Arcs** (arc ultras) are performed by dashing diagonal up+forward, curving down+forward, landing, then jumping to get the ultra boost. Other types of dashes are commonly used, such as down+forward curved to forward, and forward curved to down+forward. Buffering an ultra can result in missing the speed boost.

### Grounded Ultra
Grounded Ultras refer to dashing down+forward when grounded, which gives two 1.2x speed boosts in Superdash. When combined with dash chaining, this tech can be used to quickly reach high speeds on flat ground.

### Curved Wallbounce
A (normal) wallbounce done with a curved dash. Dash diagonal+up, hold up, then press jump towards the end of the dash. 

### Curved Wavedash
A (normal) wavedash done with a curved dash. As long as your dash ends diagonal down and touches the ground, you can jump to perform a wavedash. This includes down dashes, forward dashes, or even down+diagonal dashes that change directions more than once.

### Delayed Theo Transition (DTT)
For screen exit transitions that require Theo to be held or thrown, you can drop Theo at the exit, infinitely chain grounded ultras at the exit to build speed, then grab Theo to release all of your speed. High speed chains allow you to pass through entities like spinners and doors, effectively skipping rooms.

(Depending on the geometry of the next room, you may get stuck in the floor when trying to build too much speed.)

### Ultrahop
On the ground, demodash forward, tap a down+jump keybind, then jump again to get a bunnyhop with a 1.2x speed boost. The keybind is used to curve down for 1 frame. This lets your hitbox not collide with the ground, which saves your ultra boost for when you actually do collide with the ground and bunnyhop. In order for the ultrahop to work, you may need to wait a little after demoing (because of input buffer I'm guessing) and wait a little before the final jump (just like with regular ultras).

Reverse ultrahops are ultrahops that start with a reverse demohyper instead. AFAIK they require a 1f input of a precise analog angle in order to do get a down curve that is categorized as right, so this tech is not known to be human-viable.

### Dream Block Angles
After either grabbing or exiting a dream block, you can buffer a dash along the outside of a dream block, then immediately curve inside to get a consistent angle. You cannot change your dash angle inside a dream block.

### Dream Blocks: Phasing through walls
It is possible to travel through thin walls if you are in a dream block on the current frame and not touching the wall on the next frame. This is used in the vanilla 2B speedrun, but Superdash curving allows for this tech to be used in more places.

## Niche Tech

### Slipdash
When diagonal-down dashing from the edge of the floor into the air, your dash will not floor snap as usual (?). This allows you to curve the dash in the air, which is normally not possible with a grounded down-diagonal dash. (This is unrelated to cornerslips.)

### Wiggling
If you are in the air with no speed, the easiest way to get the most horizontal distance is to do a wiggle. Dash forward, curve forward+down, then quickly switch to forward again.

### Curved Dash Refresh
It is possible to start a horizontal dash, wait until your dash refreshes, then curve either up or down off the ground.

### Mid-dash Cornerglide
If you cornerglide in the middle of your dash, the angle of your dash seems to change abruptly to a diagonal. This allows you to achieve a dash curved more than usual. In this clip, the dash starts angled up and ends angled downright/right. (This is possible RTA but tough for analog players.)
