# Superdash Mechanics
Documenting notable mechanics in Superdash

### Curving
Superdash works the same on every basic control scheme. The game only uses inputs in the 8 main directions, even on an analog stick. The way Superdash curving works is by slowly moving you in the direction you are holding, at a rate of about 4 degrees per frame. Most curving in the speedrun can be achieved by dashing in one direction, then switching to holding a new direction.

If you collide with a wall/ceiling/floor mid-dash, you lose the ability to curve and are locked into your current dash angle.

### Demodash
After demodashing, curving down causes you to uncrouch.
