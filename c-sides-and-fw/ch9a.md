Dash Trigger Skip (Oilskip)

DTS is much more important for Superdash not only because of the SIGNIFICANTLY helpful movement buff, but because it is MUCH easier to skip the dash trigger. I would recommend everyone on Version 1.4.0.0 to take a few minutes to learn it.

1. Pause in front of Granny (rip).
2. Pause buffer your "talk" button and repause.
3. Pause buffer jump and continue to hold it until you can confirm you did the skip correctly and are infinitely floating.
4. After this final unpause, wait 16 seconds on the timer, then skip cutscene. You should land in this room.
5. To skip the dash trigger, simply do a full height jump, dash up, then dash upright. The inputs are very lenient and not precise at all, unlike in vanilla.
