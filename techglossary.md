Most, if not all tech in vanilla Celeste is possible with Superdash.

Superdash Tech:

Dash Chaining
In vanilla Celeste, you must wait until a dash ends before dashing again. In Superdash, this dash timer is the same length, even though the dash now continues for longer. This allows you to cancel your dash into another dash, which can be used to preserve or build speed.

Ultra Dash
In vanilla Celeste, ultras are performed by dashing diagonal down in midair, landing, then jumping to get a 1.2x speed boost. Ultras are also possible in Superdash, with diagonal down curves being most frequently used to perform them. Arcing/arc ultras are performed by dashing diagonal up+forward, curving down+forward, then jumping to get the ultra boost. Other types of dashes are commonly used, such as down+forward curved to forward, and forward curved to down+forward. 

Grounded Ultra
Grounded Ultras refer to dashing down+forward when grounded, which gives 2 1.2x speed boosts in Superdash. When combined with dash chaining, this tech can be used to quickly reach high speeds on flat terrain.

Dream Block Angles

After either grabbing or exiting a dream block, you can dash along the dream block outside of a dream block, then immediately curve into it to get a consistent angle into the dream block. You cannot change your dash angle inside a dream block.

ex:

Dream Blocks: Phasing through walls

It is possible to travel through thin walls if you are in a dream block on the current frame and the next frame. This is used in the vanilla 2B speedrun, but Superdash curving allows for this tech to be used in more places.

ex:

Niche Stuff:

Curved Dash Refresh

It is possible to start a horizontal dash, wait until your dash refreshes, then curve either up or down off the ground.

Mid-dash Cornerglide

If you cornerglide in the middle of your dash, the angle of your dash seems to change abruptly to a diagonal. This allows you to achieve a dash curved more than usual. In this clip, the dash starts angled up and ends angled downright. (This is possible RTA but tough for analog players.)
