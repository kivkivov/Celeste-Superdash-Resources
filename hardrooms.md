 ## (ARB) Mirror Temple A CP1 - a-03 Berry

Really the only problematic berry in the game, and it's not too bad. After taking the bubble up, you do an up dash, wait a bit, then hold right. Make sure not to hit the spikes on the way down.

This can be usually be done in 10 tries or less, but another option is pause buffering for consistency.

Take the bubble up. Pause until this frame, then pause buffer an up dash.

(Optional Visual Cue: Pause buffer until the bubble is separated/no longer touching the white point of the spinner (circled).)

Continue to pause buffer until this frame, then pause buffer and hold right. Avoid the spinners on the way down too.

(Optional Visual Cue: Pause buffer until Madeline is this far from the point of the spinner. For reference, the next frame has the top of Madeline's head touching the point/line.)

 ## Summit A 3000M - Flag 10
 
 The bain of first-time Superdashers' existences - fortunately it becomes 100% consistent if you know the setup. 
 
 Fall and dash left to the wall and then carefully position yourself on the rightmost wall to align yourself. Fall down, left dash through the gap, and hold right. This should easily set you up to hit the spring.
 
 For the final part, wall jump into the spinner section, fall into the lower right corner, then do a normal upleft dash (no curving). 
 
 ## Summit A 3000M - Flag 9
 
 The easiest and fastest strat here is to ignore the spinners. From the beginnning, extended hyper, dash up twice and grab the dash crystal on the left, then use your remaining dashes to reach the cloud on the left. Skipping the next flag, Flag 8, is recommended because it is awkward to maneuver, and grabbing it loses time for little benefit.
 
 ## Mirror Temple B CP1 - Room 4
One of the reasons why you might not want to immediately play 5B in Any%. Superdashes last too long, so it is impossible to jump off the first dash block after a down dash. You have to do a reverse coyote super instead, which means jumping after physically leaving the platform of the block. Stand on the dash block and jump right without hitting spikes. At the peak of your jump, dash left.

<img src="https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/5bc1r4.png" width="428" height="363"/>

When your dash reaches about this point, you want to input the reverse super.
 
 ## Reflection B CP2 - Room 9
 
THE hardest, most infamous room in Superdash, period. At least, without pause buffering. The ending of this room requires two very precise left-to-down curves, one immediately after the other. This room is doable without pause buffering, but it could mean taking 5 minutes of attempts instead of only one single pause buffered attempt. Even with practice, the no-pause method is still highly inconsistent. Pause buffering is the preferred method here.

[Link: Pause Buffering Explanation (Version 1.4.0.0)](https://youtu.be/ZRGMMsY8QoI?t=404)

First, pause until you fall to this height, roughly towards the left. 

After unpausing, pause buffer (repause) X frames forward. Then, pause buffer a down curve. Hold down and pause when you fall to this height. The fall can be partially or fully pause buffered.

At this height, you can repeat the same process from earlier. Pause buffer X frames forward, then hold down.

Congrats on clearing the hardest room in Superdash 100% (hopefully)!

 ## Summit B 2000M - Room 2

The hard part of this room is falling through the gap right before the end section. The beginning cycle shown here lets you enter the hard section as soon as possible, which is important. 

![cue](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7b2000m2_1.png)

As soon as you up-right dash into the hard section, fall down to the lowest, leftmost area as shown here. On the right, I have hitboxes on to show that you have more room on the bottom left and top right than you may think.
   
<img src="https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7b2000m2_2.png" width="470" height="310"/>

Initiate a right dash, then begin to hold up when you reach the area indicated here. Fall down, grab the block, and the rest of the room should be simple.

This is the 'simplest' strat here but it may be more precise for some than Option 2.

Unlike in Option 1, the beginning cycle sets you up to enter the hard section as late as possible. When you enter the hard section, do a right dash curved down so that you hit the spring. Then, you can down dash and right dash to grab the side of the block safely. You can die from accidentally cornerboosting out of the right dash while trying to climb jump, so either wait for the right dash to end before jumping or don't hold right when jumping.

Pretty difficult, so I wouldn't recommend. It's good if you hate curving maybe lol????? The idea is to grab the block at the right pixel, then demodash right, timed precisely before you are about to touch the spikes.

      <summary>Normal Strat</summary>

For the ending cloud of this room, you do a left dash curved down. For the second dash, you have two options.
   
**Right Dash Curved Down**
   
![gif](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7b2000m4_1.webp)

Start the dash from higher so you can give your dash more time to curve down. When you land, dash down on the cloud so you don't slip off.
   
**Right Dash Curved Up**
 
![gif](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7b2000m4_2.webp)

Start the dash from lower, and try to curve up later so you don't hit the spikes. You might have to hold right after the dash ends so you can land in the middle of the cloud.

Decent alternative to the normal strat.

Grab the highest Badeline orb, then fall back down and grab the higher block.
   
![cue](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7b2000m4.png)
   
Align on this pixel (Madeline's highest pixel is 3 pixels above the top of the block.). Do a max height wall jump. At the peak of the jump, demodash left, then dash down to stop yourself on the cloud.

   </details>

### **IMPORTANT:** 

Lastly, make sure to stay CROUCHED while waiting on and jumping off the cloud. You can hold crouch the entire time before dashing up. This makes it so you don't need to adjust for the wind nearly as much (or at all).

 ## Summit B 3000M - Flag 12
 
 <img src="https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7bflag12_1.webp" width="384" height="216"/>

 The second half of this flag is one of the most difficult room clears in the game. 
 
 ![gif](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7bflag12_2.webp)

 Starting after the second spring hit up top, you want to do a left dash curved down and aim to fall to the lower left corner. From there, dash right and curve up-right at the very end of the dash, then hold in towards the spring. 
 
 Optional: For the next part, to avoid going too high, you can dash back into the spring to get a lower spring hit (and to make the flag less input dense)
 
 ![gif](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7bflag12_3.webp)

 After hitting the spring, do an up-right dash shortly after and curve up immediately.

 <img src="https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7bflag12.png" width="229" height="212"/>

 Another thing you can do is dash into and grab here, then slide down into the spring. However, this changes the timing of the up-right dash.
 
 ## Summit B 3000M - Flag 2
 
<img src="https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7bflag2_1.webp" width="384" height="216"/>

 
 The hardest part of this flag is the ending section - there are two main ways you can reach the final cloud.
 
   <details>
      <summary>Option 1</summary>
  
 ![gif](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7bflag2_1.webp)

 Easier but slower method. After breaking the first cloud, use an up-right dash curved up to land on the next cloud. From there, fall, do a right dash, then a right dash curved up to land on the next cloud. Walk off the cloud (or do a short hop), then the final cloud should be simple. Using a demodash button can also help to avoid hitting spikes above you.

   </details>

      <summary>Option 2</summary>
  
![gif](https://github.com/kivkivov/Celeste-Superdash-Resources/blob/main/(media)/7bflag2_2.webp)

The fast method that isn't too much harder. After breaking the first cloud, do a right dash, then a right dash curved up rather late to grab the crystal.
 
After getting the crystal, begin holding right. Fall to the bottom, then do another right dash into a right dash curved up, reaching the final cloud.

 ## Core C - Room 3 ##
 
 Most of this room is similar to normal, with the exception of the spinner wall dash crystal section. Since your dash lasts longer, it throws the cycle off. There are many ways to deal with this, like doing diagonal dashes or avoiding a switch on the way up. The method we cover here involves waiting out certain cycles. This is less precise than other methods, and it uses the intended dash pattern.
 
For this area, you want to reach the ice switch as soon as possible.

When you activate it, you want the ice to last as long as possible. Fall down before dashing up to activate this switch.

You want to hit this next switch as fast as possible, but the intended dash pattern works fine here.

Hit the final switch as late as possible, then start fastfalling. Dash right into the crystal, do an up dash, then do an upright dash in the middle of the up dash.





 
 ## Farewell CP6 - Room 7
 
 Perhaps there are better setups, but this is the one I use.
 
 Transition hyper, then fast fall as soon as possible until the lowest point. Left dash and curve up
