 ## (ARB) Mirror Temple A CP1 - a-03 Berry

Really the only problematic berry in the game, and it's not too bad. After taking the bubble up, you do an up dash, wait a bit, then hold right. 

This can be done in a few tries, but one option is pause buffering for consistency.


Pause Buffering Explanation (Version 1.4.0.0)
Take the bubble up. Pause until this frame, then pause buffer an up dash.

THE hardest, most infamous room in Superdash, period. At least, without pause buffering. The ending of this room requires two very precise left-to-down curves, one immediately after the after. This room is doable without pause buffering, but it could mean taking 5 minutes of attempts instead of only one single pause buffered attempt. Even with practice, the no-pause method is still highly inconsistent. Pause buffering is the preferred method here.

Pause Buffering Explanation (Version 1.4.0.0)

First, pause until you fall to this height, roughly towards the left. 

After unpausing, pause buffer (repause) X frames forward. Then, pause buffer a down curve. Hold down and pause when you fall to this height. The fall can be partially or fully pause buffered.

At this height, you can repeat the same process from earlier. Pause buffer X frames forward, then hold down.

Congrats on clearing the hardest room in Superdash 100% (hopefully)!

      <summary>Option 1</summary>
   
The hard part of this room is falling through the gap right before the end section. The beginning cycle shown here lets you enter the hard section as soon as possible, which is important. As soon as you up-right dash into the hard section, fall down to the lowest, leftmost area as shown below. The hitboxes are shown in red, so you can go more left than you think you can.

Initiate a right dash, then begin to hold up when you reach the area indicated here.

Fall down, grab the block, and the rest of the room should be simple. This is the 'simplest' strat here but it may be more precise for some than Option 2.

      <summary>Option 2</summary>

Unlike in Option 1, the beginning cycle sets you up to enter the hard section as late as possible. When you enter the hard section, do a right dash curved down so that you hit the spring. Then, you can down dash and right dash to grab the side of the block safely.

      <summary>Other Options</summary>

Pretty difficult, so I wouldn't recommend. It's good if you hate curving maybe lol????? The idea is to grab the block at the right pixel, then demodash right, timed precisely before you are about to touch the spikes.

I don't think this is good but I might as well put it here.

      <summary>Normal Strat</summary>

For the ending cloud of this room, you do a left dash curved down. For the second dash, you have two options.

Right Dash Curved Up

Start the dash from lower, and try to curve late so you don't hit the spikes.

Right Dash Curved Down

Start the dash from higher so you give your dash more time to curve.

      <summary>Demodash Setup</summary>
Decent alternative to the normal strat.

Grab the highest Badeline orb, then fall back down and grab the higher block.

Align on this pixel (Madeline's highest pixel is X pixels above the top of the block.). Do a max height wall jump. At the peak of the jump, demodash left, then dash down to stop yourself on the cloud.

   </details>

**IMPORTANT:** 

Lastly, make sure to stay CROUCHED while waiting on the cloud and jumping off the cloud. This makes the jump much less precise.
