 ## (ARB) Mirror Temple A CP1 - a-03 Berry

Really the only problematic berry in the game, and it's not too bad. After taking the bubble up, you do an up dash, wait a bit, then hold right. 

This can be usually be done in 10 tries or less, but another option is pause buffering for consistency.


Pause Buffering Explanation (Version 1.4.0.0)
Take the bubble up. Pause until this frame, then pause buffer an up dash.

Continue to pause buffer until this frame, then pause buffer and hold right. Avoid the spinners on the way down too.

 ## Summit A 3000M - Flag 10
 
 The bain of first-time Superdashers' existences - fortunately it becomes 100% consistent if you know the setup. 
 
 Fall and dash left to the wall and then carefully position yourself on the rightmost wall to align yourself. Fall down, left dash through the gap, and hold right. This should easily set you up to hit the spring.
 
 For the final part, wall jump into the spinner section, fall into the lower right corner, then do a normal upleft dash (no curving). After the dash ends, you can simply fall down.
 
 
 ## Summit A 3000M - Flag 9
 
 The easiest and fastest strat here is to ignore the spinners. From the beginnning, extended hyper, dash up twice and grab the dash crystal on the left, then use your remaining dashes to reach the cloud on the left. Skipping the next flag, Flag 8, is recommended because it is awkward to maneuver, and grabbing it loses time for little benefit.
 
 ## Mirror Temple B CP1 - Room 4
Superdashes last too long, so it is impossible to jump off the first dash block with a down dash. You have to do a reverse coyote super instead - with "coyote" referring to how you must jump after physically leaving the ground of the dash block (coyote time). Stand on the dash block and jump right without hitting spikes. At the peak of your jump, dash left.
When your dash reaches about this point, you want to input the reverse super.
 
 ## Reflection B CP2 - Room 9
 
THE hardest, most infamous room in Superdash, period. At least, without pause buffering. The ending of this room requires two very precise left-to-down curves, one immediately after the other. This room is doable without pause buffering, but it could mean taking 5 minutes of attempts instead of only one single pause buffered attempt. Even with practice, the no-pause method is still highly inconsistent. Pause buffering is the preferred method here.

Pause Buffering Explanation (Version 1.4.0.0)

First, pause until you fall to this height, roughly towards the left. 

After unpausing, pause buffer (repause) X frames forward. Then, pause buffer a down curve. Hold down and pause when you fall to this height. The fall can be partially or fully pause buffered.

At this height, you can repeat the same process from earlier. Pause buffer X frames forward, then hold down.

Congrats on clearing the hardest room in Superdash 100% (hopefully)!

 ## Summit B 2000M - Room 2

   <details>
      <summary>Option 1</summary>
   
The hard part of this room is falling through the gap right before the end section. The beginning cycle shown here lets you enter the hard section as soon as possible, which is important. As soon as you up-right dash into the hard section, fall down to the lowest, leftmost area as shown below. The hitboxes are shown in red, so you can go more left than you think you can.

Initiate a right dash, then begin to hold up when you reach the area indicated here.

Fall down, grab the block, and the rest of the room should be simple. This is the 'simplest' strat here but it may be more precise for some than Option 2.

      <summary>Option 2</summary>

Unlike in Option 1, the beginning cycle sets you up to enter the hard section as late as possible. When you enter the hard section, do a right dash curved down so that you hit the spring. Then, you can down dash and right dash to grab the side of the block safely.

      <summary>Other Options</summary>

Pretty difficult, so I wouldn't recommend. It's good if you hate curving maybe lol????? The idea is to grab the block at the right pixel, then demodash right, timed precisely before you are about to touch the spikes.

I don't think this is good but I might as well put it here.

 ## Summit B 2000M - Room 4
 
   <details>
      <summary>Normal Strat</summary>

For the ending cloud of this room, you do a left dash curved down. For the second dash, you have two options.

Right Dash Curved Up

Start the dash from lower, and try to curve late so you don't hit the spikes.

Right Dash Curved Down

Start the dash from higher so you give your dash more time to curve.

      <summary>Demodash Setup</summary>
Decent alternative to the normal strat.

Grab the highest Badeline orb, then fall back down and grab the higher block.

Align on this pixel (Madeline's highest pixel is X pixels above the top of the block.). Do a max height wall jump. At the peak of the jump, demodash left, then dash down to stop yourself on the cloud.

   </details>

**IMPORTANT:** 

Lastly, make sure to stay CROUCHED while waiting on the cloud and jumping off the cloud. This makes the jump much less precise.

 ## Summit B 3000M - Flag 12
 
 Quite difficult.
 
 ## Summit B 3000M - Flag 2
 
 The hardest part of this flag is the ending section, but I'm showing easy beginning strats here as well.
 
 ## Core C - Room 3 ##
 
 Most of this room is similar to normal, with the exception of the spinner wall dash crystal section.
 
 ## Farewell CP6 - Room 7
 
 Perhaps there are better setups, but this is the one I use.
 
 Transition hyper, then fast fall as soon as possible until the lowest point. Left dash and curve up
