The hard part of this room is falling through the gap right before the end section. The beginning cycle shown here lets you enter the hard section as soon as possible, which is important. As soon as you up-right dash into the hard section, fall down to the lowest, leftmost area as shown below. The hitboxes are shown in red, so you can go more left than you think you can.

Initiate a right dash, then begin to hold up when you reach the area indicated here.

Fall down, grab the block, and the rest of the room should be simple. This is the 'simplest' strat here but it may be more precise for some than Option 2.



Unlike in Option 1, the beginning cycle sets you up to enter the hard section as late as possible. When you enter the hard section, do a right dash curved down so that you hit the spring. Then, you can down dash and right dash to grab the side of the block safely.



Other Options
Pretty difficult, so I wouldn't recommend. It's good if you hate curving maybe lol????? The idea is to grab the block at the right pixel, then demodash right, timed precisely before you are about to touch the spikes.

I don't think this is good but I might as well put it here.
