superdash is not an analog category
(vanilla Celeste refers to normal Celeste gameplay)
Beginner Advice:
Don't stress or get overwhelemed about not being able to do the difficult stuff! You can get fast times using only vanilla tech, so your focus should be on trying to learn how to manage/control your superdashing.

Special Thanks
the superdash community, for making this guide possible in the first place <3
